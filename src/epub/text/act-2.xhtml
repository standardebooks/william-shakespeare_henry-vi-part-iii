									<span>How many days will finish up the year;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>How many years a mortal man may live.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>When this is known, then to divide the times:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>So many hours must I tend my flock;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>So many hours must I take my rest;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>So many hours must I contemplate;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>So many hours must I sport myself;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>So many days my ewes have been with young;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>So many weeks ere the poor fools will ean:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>So many years ere I shall shear the fleece:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>So minutes, hours, days, months, and years,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Pass’d over to the end they were created,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Would bring white hairs unto a quiet grave.</span>

									<br/>
									<span>Gives not the hawthorn-bush a sweeter shade</span>

									<br/>
									<span>O, yes, it doth; a thousandfold it doth.</span>
